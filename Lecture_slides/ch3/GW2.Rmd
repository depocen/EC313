Q1: suppose $c_0=100, c_1=0.6, \bar{I}=150, G=150, T=100$.

(1) What is equilibrium output?
\vspace{.3in}

(2) What is disposable income?
\vspace{.3in}

(3) What is consumption?
\vspace{.3in}

(4) If $c_0$ decreases to 50, what is the change in equilibrium output?
\vspace{.3in}

(5) What is demand when $_0=100$? Does it equal output?
\vspace{.3in}



Q2: Government spending **decreases** by $500 million. 

(1) Graphically show the impact of this reduction of government spending on equilibrium output. 

(2) Graphically explain the multiplier effect of this reduction of government spending.
