# The Composition of GDP


<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>


 
 
---
# Consumption (C)

- the goods and services purchased by consumers
- the largest component of GDP



---
# Investment (I)

- also called **fixed investment** 

--

- Composed of nonresidential and residential investment
  - **Nonresidential investment**: purchases by firms of new plants or new machines
  - **Residential investment**: purchases by people of new houses or apartments
  

--

- Firms buy machines or plants to produce output in the future. People buy houses or apartments to get housing services in the future. 





---
# Government Spending (G)

- The purchases of goods and services by the federal, state, and local governments.
  - e.g. airplanes to office equipment, services provided by government employees, ...

--

- G does **not** include:
  - government transfers, like Medicare, food stamps, or social security payments
  - interest payments on the government debt



---
# Exports (X) and Imports (IM)

- Exports: the purchases of U.S. goods and services by foreigners

--

- imports: the purchases of foreign goods and services by U.S. consumers, U.S. firms, and the U.S. government

--

- **net exports** (also called **trade balance**): $X-IM$
  
- **trade surplus**: $X > IM$

- **trade deficit**: $X < IM$

--

- Do you think America typically has a trade surplus or a trade deficit? (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOPGSTB)



---
- inventory investment: 
  - the difference between goods produced and goods
sold in a given year
  - A positive inventory investment means production was higher than sales in a given year
  - is typically small and can be ignored

# The Demand for Goods

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>







---
# Total Demand for Goods

- Denote the total demand for goods by $Z$: <span style="color:blue"> $Z \equiv C+I+G+X-IM$ </span> 

--

- $\equiv$: this equation is an *identity*

--

-  It *defines* $Z$ as the sum of consumption, plus investment, plus government spending, plus exports, minus imports

--

- Here, we are trying to model the demand of human beings for goods 

--

- How can we possibly represent all of human behavior (the goal of economics) with equations?

--

- We can’t! So we make assumptions!

---
# Total Demand for Goods

- Assumption 1: "the" good
  - all firms produce the same good, which can then be used by consumers for consumption, by firms for investment, or by the government
  
--

- With this (big) simplification, we need to look at only one market — the market for “the” good — and think about what determines supply and demand in that market


---
- Assumption 2: firms are willing to supply any amount of the good at a given price level 
  
--

- This assumption allows us to focus on the role demand plays in the determination of output, and ignore the supply

--

- Assumption 3: closed economy
  - $X = 0, IM = 0$

--

- this assumption will also simplify our discussion because we won’t have to think about what determines exports and imports.


--


- the demand for goods: <span style="color:blue"> $Z \equiv C+I+G$ </span>



---
# Consumption (C)

What is the most important determinant of consumption?

--

- **disposable income**: income that remains once consumers have received transfers from the government and paid their taxes

--

- $C = C(Y_D)$
  - $C$: consumption
  - $Y_D$: disposable income 
  
--

- **when disposable income increases, so does consumption**
  - this **positive linear relation** between $C$ and $Y_D$ can be characterized by: 
  
<span style="color:blue"> $$C=c_0+c_1 \times Y_D$$ </span>


---
# Consumption (C)
<span style="color:blue"> $$C=c_0+c_1 \times Y_D$$ </span>

--

- $c_1$: **propensity to consume**
  - the change $C$ resulting from an additional dollar of $Y_D$
  
--

- $c_1$ is positive
  - An increase in $Y_D$ is likely to lead to an increase in $C$
  
--
  
- $c_1$ is less than 1
  - People are likely to consume only part of any increase in $Y_D$ and save the rest
 

---
# Consumption (C)
<span style="color:blue"> $$C=c_0+c_1 \times Y_D$$ </span>

- if $Y_D=0$, then $C=c_0$

--

- $c_0$: what people would consume if their $Y_D$ were equal to zero

- $c_0$ is positive
  - with or without income, people still need to eat! 

--

- How to consume without income?

--

- because people can sell their assets or borrow 


---
# Consumption (C)
consumption function: <span style="color:blue"> $C=c_0+c_1 \times Y_D$ </span>

```

- linear relation: the relation between $C$ and $Y_D$ is represented by a straight line 



---
# Consumption (C)

<span style="color:blue"> $$C=c_0+c_1 \times Y_D$$ </span>

- intercept with the vertical axis: $c_0$

--
  
- slope is $c_1$, and is less than 1
  - this straight line is flatter than a 45-degree line
  
--

- if the value of $c_0$ **increases**(**decreases**), then this straight line shifts **up**(**down**) by the same amount
  
  
---
# Consumption (C)

- define disposal income $Y_D$: <span style="color:blue"> $Y_D \equiv Y-T$ </span>
  - $Y$: income
  - $T$: taxes 
  
--
  
- rewrite  $C=c_0+c_1 \times Y_D$ as: <span style="color:blue"> $$C=c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)$$ </span>

--

- consumption $C$ is a function of income $Y$ and taxes $T$
  - Higher income $Y$ increases consumption $C$, but less than one for one
  - Higher taxes $T$ decrease consumption $C$, also less than one for one



---
# Investment (I)

- we take investment as given to keep our model simple: <span style="color:blue"> $I=\bar{I}$ </span>

--

- when we try to study of the effects of changes in production $Y$, we assume that changes in $Y$ will not affect investment
  
--

- **exogenous variables**: variables are not explained within the model but are instead taken as given

--

-  In Chapter 5 we will introduce a more realistic treatment of investment, and drop the bar from $\bar{I}$ :) 
  
  


---
# Government Spending (G)

- In our models, government behavior is entirely defined by Taxes $T$ and Government Spending $G$

--

- **fiscal policy**: the choice of Taxes $T$ and Government Spending $G$ by the government

--

- Again, to keep our model simple, we take Taxes $T$ and Government Spending $G$ as exogenous and given 

--

- Because we will (nearly always) take $G$ and $T$ as given, we won’t use a bar to denote their values :)

--

- **exogenous variables**: so far, we have $\bar{I}, T, G$

---
# Demand for Goods

- we have seen: $Z \equiv C+I+G$

--

- rewrite $C$ as $c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)$: 

  $$Z \equiv c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)+I+G$$
  
--

- rewite $I$ as $\bar{I}$: 

<span style="color:blue"> $$Z \equiv c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)+\bar{I}+G$$  </span>

--

- the demand for goods $Z$ depends on income $Y$, taxes $T$, investment $\bar{I}$ and government spending $G$



---
# Equilibrium in the Goods Market 

- **equilibrium** in the goods market requires that the **production** (or, the **supply**) of the good $Y$ equals the **demand** for the good $Z$

--

- equilibirum condition equation: $Y=Z$ 

--

- rewrite $Z$ as $\equiv c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)+\bar{I}+G$: 

<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)+\bar{I}+G$$  </span>

---
# Equilibrium in the Goods Market 
<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)+\bar{I}+G$$  </span>

-  **In equilibrium**, **production** $Y$ (the left-hand-side (LHS) of the equation), is equal to demand (the right-hand-side(RHS)). Demand in turn depends on **income** $Y$, which is itself equal to production

--

- Why can we use the same symbol $Y$ for production and income?

--

- recall Chapter 2, we looked at GDP either from the production side or from the income side

--

- Production and income are identically equal


---
# Equilibrium in the Goods Market

<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)+\bar{I}+G$$ </span>

- If equilibrium output $Y$ is what we want to solve for, and $Y$ is on
both sides of our equation, what do we do?
  - Using Algebra
  - Using Graphs

  
  
---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra

- $Y = c_0+c_1 \times (Y-T)+\bar{I}+G$

--

- $Y= c_0 + c_1 Y -c_1 T + \bar{I} + G$

--

- $(1-c_1) Y = c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T$

--

- solve for output $Y$: 

<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

--

- at equilibirum, the level of output $Y$ equals $\frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$, so that production equals demand


---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra

<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

- here, the equilibrium level of variable $Y$ depends on other variables in the model, i.e. $c_1$, $c_0$, $\bar{I}$, $G$, $T$; therefore, $Y$ is called **endogenous variabele**

--

- variables $\bar{I}$, $G$, $T$ are **exogenous variable**, because the level of them are taken as given

--

- variables $c_0$, $c_1$ characterize the relationships among endogenous and exogenous variabele, and called **parameters**


---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra

<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

- $[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$: **Autonomous spending** 
  - part of the demand for goods that does not depend on output $Y$
  
--

- $c_0 > 0$

--

- $\bar{I} > 0$

--

- sign of $G-c_1T$ is uncertain 

--

- what is the sign of autonomous spending?


---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra

<span style="color:blue"> $$[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

- the government is running a **balanced budget** when $T=G$

--

- when $T=G$: 
  - $c_0 + \bar{I} + G -c_1 T = c_0 + \bar{I} + (1-c_1)G$
  - because we have assumed that $c_1 < 1$
  - and since $c_0 > 0$ and $\bar{I} > 0$
  - autonomous spending is positive

  
---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra
<span style="color:blue"> $$[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

-  the government is running a **budget deficit** when $T<G$
  - when $T<G$, autonomous spending is positive (why?)
  
--
  
- the government is running a **budget surplus** when $T>G$
  - when $T>G$, sign of autonomous spending is ambiguous (why?) 

--

- Only if the government were running a very large budget surplus — if taxes were much larger than government spending — could autonomous spending be negative


---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra

<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

- we have seens that the propensity to consume $0<c_1<1$

- hence $\frac{1}{1-c_1}>1$

- for this reason, $\frac{1}{1-c_1}$ is called **multiplier**, because it **multiplies** autonomous spending $[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$ 


---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra
<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

_Example_: if $c_0$ increases by 1 billion dollars, how much will output $Y$ increases? 

--

- $\Delta Y = \Delta c_0 \times multiplier = 1 \times \frac{1}{1-c_1}> 1$

--

- here, autonomous spending increases by 1 billion, but output increases by more than 1 billions!

--

- a multiplier greater than 1 implies that, in equilibrium, output increases (or decreases) more than the increase (or decrease) in autonomous spending!

---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra

<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0 + \bar{I} +G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

_Example_: if $c_1=0.6$, and $c_0$ increases by 1 billion dollars, how much will output $Y$ increases? 

--

- $\Delta Y = \Delta c_0 \times multiplier = 1(billion)  \times \frac{1}{1-0.6}= 2.5(billion)$

--

- here, autonomous spending increases by 1 billion, but output increases by 2.5 billions!



---
# Equilibrium: Using Algebra
_Example_: Government spending increases by 500 million dollars and $c_1 = 0.5$. Solve for the change in equilibrium output associated with this increase in government spending.

--

- $\Delta Y = \Delta G \times multiplier = 500 \times \frac{1}{1-0.5}=500 \times 2=1000 (million)$

--

- any change in autonomous spending — from a change in investment, to a change in government spending, to a change in taxes — will change output by more than its direct effect on autonomous spending



---
# Group Work II
Q1: suppose $c_0=100, c_1=0.6, \bar{I}=150, G=150, T=100$. 

- What is equilibrium output?

--

- $Y=\frac{1}{1-c_1}(c_0+G+\bar{I}-c_1 T)$

- $Y=\frac{1}{1-0.6}(100+150+150-0.6*100)$

- $Y=2.5*340=850$


---
# Group Work II (cont'd)
Q1: suppose $c_0=100, c_1=0.6, \bar{I}=150, G=150, T=100$.

- What is disposable income?

--

- $Y_D = Y-T=850-100=750$

--

- What is consumption?

--

- $C=c_0+c_1 Y_D = 100+0.6*750=550$



---
# Group Work II (cont'd)
Q1: suppose $c_0=100, c_1=0.6, \bar{I}=150, G=150, T=100$.

- If $c_0$ decreases to 50, what is the change in equilibrium output?

--

- $\Delta Y = (\frac{1}{1-0.6}) \times \Delta c_0=2.5*(-50)=-125$

--

- What is demand when $c_0=100$? Does it equal output?

--

- Yes, in equilibrium, $Z=Y$ so $Y=850$



---
# Equilibrium: Using Graph

First, plotting production as a function of income: 

--

- measure production on the vertical axis, and measure income on
the horizontal axis

--

- recall that production and income are identically equal

--

- hence, the relation between production $Y$ and income $Y$ is the 45-degree line, the line with a slope equal to 1


---
# Equilibrium: Using Graph
**slope equals 1**

```{r, echo=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis', warnings=FALSE}
plot_labels <- tibble(label = c("production"),
                          x = c(8),
                          y = c(8))
production <- Hmisc::bezier(x = c(1, 9),
                        y = c(1, 9)) %>% as_tibble()
ggplot(mapping=aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_path(data = production, color = "#808080", size = 1) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  coord_equal()+
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))+
  xlab("Income Y") + ylab("Production Y")+
  geom_text(data = plot_labels,

        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
```

---
# Equilibrium: Using Graph

Second, plot demand as a function of income:

--

- measure demand on the vertical axis, and measure income on
the horizontal axis

--

- recall that: $Z = (c_0 + \bar{I}+ G - c_1 T)+ c_1 Y$, and $0<c_1<1$

--

- the relationship between demand $Z$ and income $Y$ is a line that is upward sloping but has a slope of less than 1

---
# Equilibrium: Using Graph

- slope is $c_1$, which is between 0 and 1**
- intercept is $c_0 + \bar{I}+ G - c_1 T)$

```{r, echo=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis', warnings=FALSE}
plot_labels <- tibble(label = c("demand"),
                          x = c(4),
                          y = c(3))
demand <- Hmisc::bezier(x = c(0, 9),
                        y = c(1, 4)) %>% as_tibble()
ggplot(mapping=aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_path(data = demand, color = "#FF66B2", size = 1) + 
  theme_classic() +

# Equilibrium
<span style="color:blue"> $$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0 + \bar{I} + G -c_1 T]$$ </span>

- The size of the multiplier $\frac{1}{1-c_1}$ is directly related to the value of the propensity to consume $c_1$

--

- The higher the propensity to consume, the higher the multiplier

--

- A reasonable estimate of the propensity to consume in the United States today is around 0.6

--

- This implies that the multiplier is equal to $\frac{1}{1-c_1}=\frac{1}{1-0.6}=2.5$

# Fears of Another Great Depression

$C=c_0+c_1Y_D$

Why did consumption, and especially, consumption of durables, decrease at the end of 2008 despite relatively small changes in disposable income $Y_D$? 

<img src="../ch3/image/3.png" width=600>

- Total consumption decreased, and consumption of durables collapsed

- on September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt

- in the ensuing weeks, it appeared that many more banks might follow suit and the financial system might collapse

- Even though people still had their job and received monthly income, the events reminded them of the stories of the Great Depression 

- worried that you might become unemployed or that your income might decline in the future, you would probably cut consumption even if your disposable income had not yet changed

<img src="../ch3/image/4.png" width=600>

- the series that gives the number of searches for “Great Depression” peaked in October 2008
