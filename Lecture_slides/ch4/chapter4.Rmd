# Chapter 4: Financial Markets I

1. [The Demand for Money](#The Demand for Money)

2. [Determining the Interest Rate](#Determining the Interest Rate)










---
Why study financial markets?

--

- In order to understand how the interest rate is determined in the short run!


--

- The goods market we outlined in Chapter 3 did not include an interests rate, but in the real world, the interest rate is mentioned in the news almost every
day!

--

- The Goods Market model does not have a role for a Central Bank like the Federal Reserve

--

- In short; we study financial markets to understand a realistic element of our economic activity!



---
In chapter 4: 

- Ignore all financial assets except for **bonds** and **money** (meaning we ignore houses, stock investments, etc)

--

- bonds: A financial asset that represents a debt contract between the issuer (borrower) and the buyer (lender)

--

- When you buy a bond with a face value (principal) F = \$1000 issued by the US government, you lend $1, 000 to the US government




---
- As a borrower, the US government will pay you interest. If the annual **interest rate** is 10%, each year you would receive $100 = 10% ∗ 1000

--

- **interest rate**: price of money

--

- The interest rate will be determined by equilibrium in the money market: **Money Supply = Money Demand**

# The Demand for Money

- In order to describe money market equilibrium, we first must understand the demand for money.

--

- **Money** is the sum of currency and checkable deposits
  - **Currency**: paper money, coins, etc
  - **Checkable Deposits**: deposits you have stored with a bank
  
--

- Money is used to make transactions, but it does not earn interest

--

- **Bonds** pay interest rates but cannot be used for transactions

--

- We assume there is only one type of bond, which pays positive interest rate $i$
  
  
---
# The Demand for Money

- Why hold a mixture of bonds and money?

--

- First, I need to make transactions! Ex: I buy coffee almost every day. I cannot use
bonds to buy coffee, so I make sure that I have some money

--

- Second, thankfully, I do not spend ALL of my money on coffee. If I’m not using all of my money, I should buy bonds so that I can earn interest.



---
# The Demand for Money

- What determines my proportion of bond holdings to money holdings?

--

- First, *level of transactions*
  - the more purchases I make, the more money (and fewer bonds) I will hold (for a fixed interest rate)
  
--

- Second, *interest rate on bonds*
  - the higher the interest rate on bonds, the more bonds and less money I will hold (for a fixed level of transactions)
  

  
---
# The Demand for Money

- A higher interest rate means the opportunity cost of holding money has
increased

--

- Back to the US government bond example: If interest rate increases to
20% per year, you would receive $200 a year. You might want to consider holding more bonds instead of money

# Deriving Demand for Money

- Money Demand is denoted by $M^D$: 
<span style="color:blue"> $$M^D = \$ Y \times L(i)$$ </span>
- nominal income: $Y
- interest rate: $i$ 
  
--

- why does nominal income affect $M^D$?

--

- nominal income is proportional to the level of transactions, and hence determines money holdings


---
# Deriving Demand for Money

- why does $i$ affect $M^D$?

--

- $i$ determines holdings of bond, and hence affect money holdings 

--

- Do you think $L(i)$ is increasing or decreasing in $i$? 

--

-  An increase in the interest rate decreases the demand for money, as people put more of their wealth into bonds



---
# Deriving Demand for Money

<span style="color:blue"> $$M^D = \$ Y \times L(i)$$ </span>

In summary: 

--

- First, the demand for money $M^D$ increases in proportion to nominal income

--

- Second, the demand for money  $M^D$ depends **negatively** on the interest rate $i$

--

- How to graphically express the relationship between $M^D$ and $i$, given a level of nominal income?

---
# Deriving Demand for Money

<span style="color:blue"> $$M^D = \$ Y \times L(i)$$ </span>

- interest rate $i$ is measured on the vertical axis
- demand for money is measured on the horizontal axis 
- The relation between the demand for money $M^D$ and the interest rate $i$ **for a given level of nominal income** is represented by the $M^d$ curve

# Deriving Demand for Money

<img src="../ch4/image/1.png" width=400>

- What happens when the **interest rate** increases or decreases in our graph?

--

- We **move along** the curve $M^D$


---
# Deriving Demand for Money

<img src="../ch4/image/2.png" width=400>

- What happens when **nominal income** increases(decreases) in our graph?

--

- We **shift** the $M^D$ curve to the right(left)

# Supply of Money

In the real world, there are two types of money: currency and checkable deposits. 

--

- for simplicity, we assume that the only money in the economy is currency

--

- **Currency**: Money supplied by central banks. This is the paper (or coin) money that we use on a daily basis

--

- Currency is supplied by the Federal Reserve in the U.S.


---
# Supply of Money

- We have outlined the money demand equation $M^D$, we must now
characterize money supply $M^s$

- The Money Supply is characterized by: 
<span style="color:blue"> $$M^s = M$$ </span>
