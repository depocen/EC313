Q3: Suppose a country using the United Statesâ€™ system of calculating official unemployment statistics has 100 million people, of whom 50 million are working age. Of these 50 million, 20 million have jobs. Of the remainder: 10 million are actively searching for jobs; 10 million would like jobs but are not searching; and 10 million do not want jobs at all. What is the value of the labor force? What is the official unemployment rate?
